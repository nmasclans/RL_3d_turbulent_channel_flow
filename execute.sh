# TODO: INSTALL REDIS, ONLY REDISAI INSTALLED!
# It looks like you have RedisAI installed, but you don't seem to have Redis itself installed, which is likely why redis-cli isn't working. RedisAI depends on Redis being installed and running. Hereâ€™s how you can handle this:

# Option 1: Install Redis
# If you want to use Redis from the official package, you would generally install it using:

# bash
# Copia el codi
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install redis-server

#mpirun -np 8 --hostfile my-hostfile ./RHEA.exe configuration_file.yaml
mpirun --mca btl_base_warn_component_unused 0 -np 2 --hostfile my-hostfile ./RHEA.exe configuration_file.yaml
